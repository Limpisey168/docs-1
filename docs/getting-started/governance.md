The UMA token is a governance token which grants voting rights to all holders.  

There are two main types of decisions that UMA token holders are asked to make decisions about

**UMA Improvement Proposals**

Known as UMIPs these documents propose changes to the UMA ecosystem.  Any change must go through this process to gain community approval before it is implemented.  Common types of UMIP include the addition of a new collateral currency, or a new price identifier, which specifies which prices will be referenced and where they will be sourced from 

**Liquidation Disputes**

Should a dispute over liquidation occur, token holders will be asked to supply the price that they believe to be correct using the collateral currency and the price identifier used in the priceless contract where the liquidation has occurred.

Holders are rewarded for participation in governance by a 5% reward for voting in congruence with the majority, incentivising considered participation. Changes to the UMA ecosystem are proposed as UMIPs (UMA Improvement Proposal) and voted on through a binary yes/no vote; while liquidation disputes are handled by token holders calculating the “true price” at the time of the liquidation and entering that into the voting.
