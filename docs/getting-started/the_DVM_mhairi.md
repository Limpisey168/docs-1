The data verification mechanism is the mechanism by which the UMA ecosystem is secured.

The security of the oracle is maintained by ensuring that the correct prices are received according to the collateral and price feed determined within the priceless contract, and through ensuring that the cost of corrupting the oracle is always greater than the potential profit that could be made from doing so. 

Token holders who wish to participate in dispute resolution must calculate and provide a “true price” at the time of liquidation which can be used to determine whether the liquidation was valid or if it was erroneous.  Congruent voters receive 5% inflationary rewards for participating in the vote, incentivising them to vote correctly. 

Should a contract wish to use the DVM, it must pay fees for that use.  There are two types of fees, regular fees and final fees.  Regular fees must be paid periodically for the lifetime of the contract, while the final fee is a flat fee charged on each price request that the contract makes.  These fees are used to buy and burn UMA tokens, reducing the supply and pushing up the market price of the token.  These fees can be adjusted as necessary to ensure that the cost of corruption is always greater than the potential profit to be made.
