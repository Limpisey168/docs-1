The UMA community consists of tokenholders, financial engineers, product designers developers and users. No matter which bucket you fall in, we're happy to have you join. We are a friendly bunch, and always willing to help people who have just discovered UMA make the most out of our innovations. 

Our community can usually be found hanging out on [Discord](https://discord.umaproject.org/),  where you can find details on upcoming proposals and votes, get support with using UMA tokens and products as well as exploring new ideas and how we can turn them into reality. 

We also have a [Discourse](https://discourse.umaproject.org/), where improvements to our protocol are discussed as well as proposing ideas for new products. We also maintain a forum where UMA community members can [showcase their talents](https://discourse.umaproject.org/c/finding-people/talent-available/24), and product teams can [offer bounties](https://discourse.umaproject.org/c/finding-people/opportunities-at-uma-collaborators/22) to our community for collaborative working. 

You can also keep up to date with what is happening in UMA by following our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UMAprotocol); longer form explorations of UMA developments are available on our [Medium](https://medium.com/uma-project), while our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3qS7FXxCd7gBMLttmTirw/playlists) channel hosts presentations and tutorials in video format.
