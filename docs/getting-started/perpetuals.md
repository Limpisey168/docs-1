In contrast to expiring contracts, Perpetual contracts are priceless financial contracts which do not expire. 
Without the promise of impending expiry, synthetic token holders can no longer assume that their synthetic tokens can be redeemed at a pre-determined time in the future for a pre-determined value. Instead, a mechanism is introduced to nudge the perpetual token to its' fair value through a “funding rate” which forces a payment between token sponsors and holders in order to push the synthetic token’s price in one direction.

When the perpetual contract’s synthetic token is trading “too high” relative to its tracking price, then a payment can be made from holders (who are long the token) to sponsors (who are short the token) to discourage marginal buyers. This “error” between the synthetic tokens’ market value and the current value of the price identifier can be linearly mapped to a “funding rate”, which is a % of each token’s value that is transferred between sponsor and holder. 

Funding rate payments are made between token holders (longs) and sponsors (shorts) to ensure the price of the synthetic is the same as the asset it is tracking.  The “payment” is an adjustment to the synthetic token value to incentivize market participants to move its synthetic token price in tandem with the price identifier (i.e., the asset it is tracking).

We should describe how funding rates are proposed (who does it, why they do it, what reward they get)

Would that not be covered more in the additional material that is being written on the Perpetual?

I feel that might get a bit technical for this section.
