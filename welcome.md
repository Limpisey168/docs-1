UMA stands for "Universal Market Access" 

UMA's mission is to make financial markets universally fair and accessible.

UMA is driven by a shared belief that financial markets should be universally accessible - unrestrained by censorship, pre-existing financial and social capital, or beliefs and values. The economic freedom created by open markets enables everyone equal access and footing to pursue prosperity and build their financial independence. Universal access to financial markets is a pre-requisite to a free, open and fair financial system. 


UMA's purpose is to enable anyone to attain or transfer any form of risk seamlessly and securely, thus empowering anyone to participate in a universally fair and accessible financial system.


## What is UMA ##

UMA is open source infrastructure for developers to create financial instruments in a permissionless, secure and efficient manner. 

This infrastructure includes:
 - [Priceless financial contract templates](getting-started/priceless-financial-contracts.md) which can be used to create synthetic tokens
 - An optimistic oracle known as the [Data Verification Mechanism](getting-started/oracle.md) (DVM) to enforce financial contracts built on UMA

These components enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure synthetic assets on Ethereum. 

**For Developers**

If you are a developer interested in building with UMA Protocol, view [this](https://docs.umaproject.org/synthetic-tokens/what-are-synthetic-assets) explainer of how UMA's priceless synthetic tokens work.


Follow the [development guide](https://docs.umaproject.org/build-walkthrough/build-process) to launch your own expiring synthetic tokens on UMA.

You can find additional reference materials, including a list of UMA's testnet and mainnet contracts [here](https://docs.umaproject.org/dev-ref/addresses).
