UMA builds open-source infrastructure for “priceless” financial contracts on Ethereum. Specifically, this is two things:

- [Priceless financial contract templates](getting-started/synthetic-tokens.md) used to create synthetic tokens
- [Decentralized Oracle Service](getting-started/oracle.md) used to manage and enforce contracts on UMA

Together, these two technologies enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure derivatives on Ethereum.
