Synthetic tokens are collateral backed tokens whose value fluctuates depending on the token’s price identifier.  

They are a form of financial derivative that traditionally have only been available to institutional investors, however through UMA, anyone can access these financial products through the blockchain.

Synthetic tokens are minted in exchange for token sponsors depositing collateral in the priceless contract.  Through using these synthetic assets, sponsors can hold tokens that track the value of other assets - on or off the blockchain.  Furthermore, contracts can be created that reference a non-financial indicator, such as the dominance of Bitcoin within the crypto ecosystem.

UMA offers tools to make it easy to build expiring or perpetual synthetic assets.  Over time UMA will expand to other types of financial contracts that will take on UMA’s priceless contract design and be secured by our Optimistic Oracle.
