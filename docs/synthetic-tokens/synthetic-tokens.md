UMA offers tools to make it easy to build expiring or perpetual synthetic assets.  Synthetic tokens are collateral backed tokens whose value fluctuates depending on the token’s reference index. Synthetic tokens are a type of financial derivative that traditionally have only been available to institutional investors, however through UMA, anyone can access these financial products through the blockchain.

Synthetic tokens are minted in exchange for depositing collateral. Synthetic assets enable investors to hold tokens that track the value of other assets - in the physical world or on-chain.  Furthermore, synthetic assets that reference a non-financial indicator, such as the dominance of Bitcoin within the crypto ecosystem, can be created on UMA.

Some examples of synthetic tokens include:

- Synthetic real-world assets (eg: gold or Tesla stock price)
- Synthetic cross-chain cryptoassets
- Tracking tokens for various non-tradable indices

Some of the most creative ideas for synthetic tokens fall in the last category. Check out the discussion on Discord for more project ideas like:

- Tokens that track the future usage of DeFi projects (e.g. assets locked in Uniswap)
- Tokens that track the number of downloads of a Chrome extension (e.g. Metamask)
- Tokens that track the success of trade ideas on r/WallStreetBets

By changing the price identifier of a priceless synthetic token, you can create synthetic tokens that behave like tokenized versions of other derivatives, like options.

Over time UMA will expand to other types of financial contracts that will take on UMA’s priceless contract design and be secured by our Optimistic Oracle.
