## KPI Option Overview

Community options, growth options or performance options - the naming is not the point, more that these options are designed to create aligned incentives with your community to grow. We have decided to call them *Key Performance Indicator options* or *KPI options*. 

### What are KPI options? 

Using UMA’s Expiring Multi Party (EMP) contract template, any project can create an incentive mechanism which offers rewards to their targeted community in exchange for the community’s support in helping them achieve their Key Performance Metrics. 

At a high-level, KPI options are synthetic ERC20 tokens that can be redeemed , but only if the project hits it’s predetermined KPI targets before expiry. These targets are up to each project and could be TVL, number of contracts deployed, number of transactions, etc.

Every community member airdropped these KPI options, becoming vested in helping the project succeed on its Key Metrics, as the token grows more valuable as the target approaches.  This provides powerful incentive alignment between the protocol and its community. 

### How it works?

The first step is create an UMIP to add your token to our list of accepted collateral currencies (if it isn’t already). Then you'll need to 
define the Key Performance Metrics. This can be any metric that is important to you, and that you think the community can help you achieve.

Once the necessary UMIPs have been passed, the project will launch the contract.  After, they will lock your tokens tokens in the contract and mint the KPI Option tokens. 
The KPI options tokens can then be airdropped to community members. This can be current token holders or others, but presumably you’ll want them to be enthusiastic about helping you achieve your targets. 

On contract expiry, the synthetics will be redeemable according to the KPI’s progress. Alternatively, a project could decide to create a new KPI option to “roll over” into, compounding their own success and growth.

### Create options using UMA

UMA has a flexible [contract template](https://docs.umaproject.org/synthetic-tokens/what-are-synthetic-assets#the-expiringmultiparty-emp-contract-template) which has freedom to adjust contract parameter as needed (ie., collateral currency, expiry date, price identifier, etc.)

The project has the freedom to choose high value airdrop recipients, including their ideal community members, effective helpers or contributors to their ecosystem.

Our unique [DVM solution](https://docs.umaproject.org/synthetic-tokens/glossary#dvm) allows for an optimistic and economically incentivized decentralized solution to an otherwise, corruptible centralized oracle.
