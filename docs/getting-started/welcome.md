UMA stands for Universal Market Access and has a mission is to make financial markets universally fair and accessible.

UMA is driven by a shared belief that financial markets should be free, open and fair. The economic freedom created by open market access enables everyone equal access to pursue prosperity and build financial independence.  

UMA's goal is to enable anyone to attain or transfer any form of risk seamlessly and securely through UMA protocol to empower everyone to participate in a universally accessible financial system.


## What is UMA?

UMA is open-source infrastructure for deploying and enforcing synthetic assets on Ethereum. UMA enables developers to quickly and easily build synthetic tokens that track the price of anything! View [here](synthetic-tokens/what-are-synthetic-assets.md) to learn more about synthetic tokens!

UMA enables developers to create synthetic assets via two core components:

- [Priceless financial contract templates](getting-started/synthetic-tokens.md)
- [Decentralized Oracle Service](getting-started/oracle.md)

Together, these two components enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure synthetic derivatives on the Ethereum blockchain.
