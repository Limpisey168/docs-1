UMA Improvement Proposals are used to propose changes to the UMA ecosystem.

They are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into the UMA protocol.  Common UMIPs include adding a new collateral currency or price identifier, however other forms of UMIPs - such as adding a new type of priceless contract - can also be proposed.

Anyone may propose an UMIP according to the template provided by UMA; the UMIP is then published in draft form to allow members of the community to consider and discuss its contents.  The UMIP author is responsible for building community consensus around the proposal and addressing any implementation issues brought up by the community or the Core Devs.

A weekly UMIP review call takes place every Monday at 15.00 GMT, where the community can discuss the UMIP and move it into a last call status, where proposers have 48 hours to address any final issues before the UMIP is put to the vote later that week.
